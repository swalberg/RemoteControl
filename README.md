# USB IR blaster

This is a simple IR Blaster for my Motorola DCT-2xxx. It acts as a USB serial device and accepts commands over that channel and blasts them out an IR LED.

It's currently built on an Arduino Uno but I want to move it to a PIC18f4550.

More details to come, including schematics and boards.
